## vary similar to list functions
## they immutable => cannot be modified
coordinates = (2,7)## tuple always go with () help to store value
##coordinates[1] = 29 ## is going to giv an err
print(coordinates[1]) ## print first index. elt inside the tuple can be easily accessed

## diff between list(can b changed) an tupp (immutable) exp coordinate
## we can have a list inside of a tuple
